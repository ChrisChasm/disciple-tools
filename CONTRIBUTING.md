# How to contribute

We welcome all contributors to this project. We need you!

# Architecture

Remember that this plugin is meant to be activated alongside the [Disciple Tools Theme](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-theme). Your changes may need to span both repositories.

Please file all issues in this repository. Pull requests should be made against the plugin or the theme or both, depending on where the changes are made.

# Where to start

If you're looking for good issues to start working on, have a look at all the issues tagged [`help wanted`](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or [`good first issue`](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools/labels/good%20first%20issue).

# Coding conventions

- We indent PHP files using four spaces (soft tabs). We recommend setting up your editor to read and understand the settings in [`.editorconfig`](./.editorconfig).
- Other than the indentation rule, we attempt to follow all the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/) for PHP and HTML.
- Our tests run PHPCS against a custom PHPCS ruleset. We recommend setting up your editor to take `phpcs.xml` into account and to highlight violations.
