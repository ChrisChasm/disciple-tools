# DMM CRM Plugin
A contact relationship management system for discipleship making movements. Wordpress plugin.

##Description
DMM CRM is a contact relationship management system (CRM) specially designed to support outreach projects using digital marketing to accelerate disciple making movements (DMM).

##Purpose
There needs to exist a simple, low-cost, highly distributable CRM that is tailored to the process of using digital marketing to accelerate disciple making movements (M2DMM). Most CRM solutions are too expensive to be used by small volunteer teams, and they often require significant configuration and development to implement. This project is attempting to make a rapid launch, low cost system that is tailored for movements.

##Platform
We are building on the Wordpress platform because of its open-source availability, simplicity of installation, numerous low cost hosting options, multi-lingual support, substantial configurability and customization, giant development community and resources, (soon to be) native REST API, mobile readiness, and healthy market place for distributing themes and plugins.
