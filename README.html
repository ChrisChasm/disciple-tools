<p>A disciple relationship management system for discipleship making movements. Wordpress plugin.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Disciple Tools is a disciple relationship management (DRM) system especially designed to support outreach projects using digital marketing to accelerate disciple making movements (DMM).</p>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>There needs to exist a simple, low-cost, highly distributable DRM that is tailored to the process of using digital marketing to accelerate disciple making movements. Most DRM solutions are too expensive to be used by small volunteer teams, and they often require significant configuration and development to implement. This project is attempting to make a rapid launch, low cost system that is tailored for movements.</p>

<h2 id="platform">Platform</h2>

<p>We are building on the Wordpress platform because of its open-source availability, simplicity of installation, numerous low cost hosting options, multi-lingual support, substantial configurability and customization, giant development community and resources, (soon to be) native REST API, mobile readiness, and healthy market place for distributing themes and plugins.</p>
