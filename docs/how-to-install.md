## Step 2
- Open up your Wordpress site, login to your Admin Dashboard. 
- Then on the admin navigation, go to "Plugins". 

> Note: You have to be an administrator with the permissions to install plugins.

## Step 3
- At the top of the "Add New" plugins screen, select the "Upload Plugin" button at the top of the page. 
- Use the file upload tool, to upload the .zip file you saved in Step #1.

## Step 4
- Once uploaded, "Activate" the plugin. Done!
