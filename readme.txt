1. Step 2
- Open up your Wordpress site, login to your Admin Dashboard.
- Then on the admin navigation, go to "Plugins".

> Note: You have to be an administrator with the permissions to install plugins.

1. Step 3
 - At the top of the "Add New" plugins screen, select the "Upload Plugin" button at the top of the page.
 - Use the file upload tool, to upload the .zip file you saved in Step #1.

directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
